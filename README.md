**For developer info, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

**The old [Hajk 2 documentation](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/blob/master/HAJK2_README.md) with detailed installation instructions (Swedish only) is now in a separate readme.**


## Quick start
_Note that Hajk consists of 3 applications: the main 'client' (which is the web map front end), 'admin' (which basically is a frontend for client's configuration files) and 'mapservice' (the backend server application which has a REST API)._

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk.git`.
1. The client app is configured by editing `new-client/public/appConfig.json`. Make sure that `mapserviceBase` is a valid URL to a running instance of MapService that is reachable from your computer (see the following steps for how to deploy a working backend).
1. The client application resides inside `new-client`, so you can do: `cd new-client` and then `npm i && npm start`. (Note that if you have not yet configured a working backend in `appConfig.json`, you will get an error here â€“ don't worry, we'll fix that soon.)
1. The admin application is located in `new-admin`. To get it running do `cd new-admin && npm i && npm start`.
1. The client and admin are accompanied by a backend (and an optional proxy) written in .NET. Open both projects in Visual Studio (in `mapservice` and `util` if you need a proxy), then Build and Publish.
1. Deploy to IIS, make sure that everything is running (choose "Browse" from IIS to see the mapservice page that lists available commands - if you see that, you're good to go). Make sure that the URL your mapservice is running on is the same as specified in client's `appConfig.json`. 
1. Now you should have client running on localhost:3000 and admin on localhost:3001. Open a browser window and check them out!

To build admin or client, just do `npm run build` instead of `npm start`. This will create a subfolder (`build`) that you can rename and serve as static files from any web server.
