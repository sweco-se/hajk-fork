/**
 * HOW TO USE THIS HELPER
 * Import this helper wherever you want to use the get/set methods.
 * This helper is initiated once, on export, and we set the key name
 * once (in index.js), so you don't have to worry about the details.
 * Just get/set whatever you want.
 *
 * Please not however that THERE IS A TWIST HERE TO THE  USUAL LOCALSTORAGE
 * behavior!
 *
 * A. This helper is map-specific. That means that ALL SETTINGS RELEATED TO A
 * MAPCONFIG WILL BE HELD IN ONE KEY/VALUE PAIR IN LOCALSTOREGE.
 * B. Because we only have one value to play with for all the settings, and
 * LocalStorage stores values as string, we utilized JSON.stringify and JSON.parse.
 *
 * === Example for map config 'map_1' ===
 * We can use this helper as follows.
 *
 * === Storing map-specific data ===
 * LocalStorageHelper.set("foobar", [1,2,3]);
 *
 * This will create/modify the following in browser's LocalStorage:
 * map_options_map_1: "{\"foobar\":[1,2,3]}"
 * If there were any other keys (except "foobar") THEY WON'T BE TOUCHED!
 *
 * === Retrieving map-specific data ===
 * LocalStorageHelper.get("foobar", "default value")
 *
 * This can do one of two things:
 * - if there was a key named "foobar" for current entry, we'll get the JSON.parsed results
 * - if there was no entry named "foobar", we'll get "default value" back
